 I first decided to remove the formInsert.html, and create 1 home page.
 
 I created a new database instead of roscripts, called myDB. 

 I then created using the create.php file, a new table and called it contacts. This table will contain the names, jobs and phone numbers of people. I assigned the phone numbers as a primary key, seeing as it is the only unique thing people own. 
 
 In the home page I created, you are able to access all of the information on this table. 

 I added the table to the home page so that whoever is using the website can take a look at what already exists in the query, and decide accordingly whether they would like to add a new contact, delete an existing contact, or update an existing contact. 
 
 I then thought the update should have its own page where they could view in details everything about the contact they are about to edit.

 The last thing I did was add some design and color to the page.
