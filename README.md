 I first decided to remove the formInsert.html, and create 1 home page
 I kept the query as it is, I thought it was not so important what content
 the database was going to have, whether for a school, employees, 
 customers, or just plain old articles.
 I added the table so that whoever is using the website can take 
 a look at what already exists in the query, and decide accordingly
 whether they would like to add a new item, delete an existing item, 
 or update an existing item.
 I then thought the update should have its own page where they could view
 in details everything about the entry they are about to edit.
 I had some trouble with the edit that I could not find.
 I spent three hours looking for what the problem is only to find out 
 that I added '' in a place where I shouldn't have :(
 The last thing I did was add some design and color to the page.
